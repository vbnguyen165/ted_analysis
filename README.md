# TED TALKS DATA ANALYSIS
This is a personal project that analyzes data on online TED Talks to find out ways to extend TED's impact on the world.

If you are interested in demonstrate the creation of a TED Talk database with user reviews, please refer to <a href="https://github.com/vbnguyen165/Ted-Talks-Database">this repository</a>.

Four main hypotheses put forward is:

- (1) The popularity of a TED talk depends on its speaker.
- (2) TED Talks marketing strategy is not strong.
- (3) The duration of a talk also affects its popularity.
- (4) Topics related to technology, despite being promoted the most, are not appealing to the
audience.
